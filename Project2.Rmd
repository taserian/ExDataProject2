# Project 2

## Project Details

### Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### Data

The data for this assignment are available from the course web site as a single zip file:

* [Data for Peer Assessment [29Mb]](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)

The zip file contains two files:

PM2.5 Emissions Data (`summarySCC_PM25.rds`): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.

* `fips`: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
* `SCC`: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
* `Pollutant`: A string indicating the pollutant
* `Emissions`: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
* `type`: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
* `year`: The year of emissions recorded

Source Classification Code Table (`Source_Classification_Code.rds`): This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.

You can read each of the two files using the `readRDS()` function in R. For example, reading in each file can be done with the following code:
````
## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")
````

as long as each of those files is in your current working directory (check by calling dir() and see if those files are in the listing).

### Assignment

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

### Questions

#### Question 1

**Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.**

#### Answer

![plot1](plot1.png) 

The data shows a decline, more pronounced from 1999 to 2002 and from 2005 to 2008, and a much smaller reduction between 2002 to 2005.

***

#### Question 2

**Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.**

#### Answer

![plot2](plot2.png) 

Data shows an increase between 2002-2005, but other three-year periods have shown a decline similar to the rate in Question 1. 

***

#### Question 3

**Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.**

![plot3](plot3.png) 

The nonpoint, nonroad and onroad source types have shown a decline across the whole period, with the period between 
2002 to 2005 showing almost no decline (even a very slight increase for nonroad).

The point source type shows an increase from 1999 to 2005, then a severe reduction in 2008 to just above the measurement in 1999.

***

#### Question 4

**Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?**

![plot4](plot4.png)

Aside from a slight increase between 2002 and 2005, there's been a decline from about 5.7 * 10^5 tons in 1999 to 3.3 * 10^5 tons in 2008, showing a 43% decline across the whole period.

***

#### Question 5

**How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?**

![plot5](plot5.png)

Data shows an incredible decrease from just above 400 tons in 1999 to 140 tons in 2008, a reduction of about 2/3rds.

***

#### Question 6

**Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?**

![plot6](plot6.png)

Where the variations in measurements in Baltimore have been in steady decline, the changes across Los Angeles measurements 
dwarfs the actual values from Baltimore. In fact, the increase in vehicular PM2.5 emissions between 2002 and 2005 in Los Angeles is about the same as the total vehicular emissions for Baltimore in 2008.
